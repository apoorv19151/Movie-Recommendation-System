# Movie Recommendation System

* In this project, I have generated movie recommendations based on past user activities using association rule mining.
* Used fpgrowth algorithm from the mlxtend library to generate frequent itemsets and association rules.
* Performed data pre-processing to compute average rating and movie-tags for each movie in the dataset based on user activity.
